1. Create two linked hash sets {"George", "Jim", "John", "Blake", "Kevin", "Michael"} and {"George", "Katie", "Kevin", "Michelle", "Ryan"} and find their union, difference, and intersection. (You can clone the sets to preserve the original sets from being changed by these set methods.)

2. Write a program that reads words from a text file and displays all the nonduplicate words in ascending order. (Use a TreeSet to hold the words)
